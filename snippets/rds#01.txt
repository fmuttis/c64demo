rasterbar dream series #1 : horisontal raster lines
by mr. rasterblaster

welcome to the first of the rasterbar dream series.
as my knowledge of c64-assembler, the vic-chip and
the 6502 grows stronger, many of these rasterbar-
effects will improve.

upcoming project:
16x vertical rasterbars using only the $d020.
